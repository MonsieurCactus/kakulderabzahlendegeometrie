# Kalk√ºl der Abzahlende Geometrie

Schubert calculus is named after Hermann Schubert who wrote his book on a new kind of counting geometry in 1879.

The goal of our project is to prove a modern rendition and an English translation.  Our starting point are the image files
from [archive.org](https://archive.org/details/kalklderabzh00schuuoft) and the full text available.

In the advent of [MathJax](http://www.mathjax.org/) it is possible to write this book as an HTML page
or as traditional LaTeX.  MathJax does not render in [GitHub flavored markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown/),
but we can post our results on Github pages in the `gh-pages` branch.

**Strategy** - divide the book into its original chapters and sections and translate piece by piece.  As this is
an exercise in *mathematics* and not just translation, I will keep my personal notes and observations in separate files.

With [Google translate](www.google.com/translate) it may be possible to translate large sections of the book with relative ease,
checking the results make sense.
